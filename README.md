This app is released under the GPLv3.  The source code can be found here.
The official Inkscape logo has been used.  It is trademarked by Inkscape, and licenced CC-By-SA 3.0. The original author is Andrew Michael Fitzsimon.

This app is not created by the main Inkscape development team.  Instead it is an adaptation that allows the Linux version to run on Android.
